GOAL OF LAB:
The goal of this lab is to create a binary search tree that can read an input file holding data that is used to insert into the tree. 
We would create traversal methods for depth-first and breadth-first traversal. 
Lastly, they should visit each node in those traversal methods and write to two separate output files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE:

1) Find the appropriate directory to compile the program (this is the folder you will place the input file and .java file in)
2) To compile the program, please copy paste the following without the quotation marks: 

	"javac BinarySearchTree.java"

3) The cmd prompt should not have gotten any errors by now, and you should be ready to run the program. Please tyoe the following:

	"java BinarySearchTree [inputfile] [outputfile1] [outputfile2]"

Please insert the file you are reading in "inputfile" and the names of the output files you are creating in "outputfile1" and "outputfile2".
"outputfile1" will be your designated Depth-First In-Order Traversal file.
"outputfile2" will be your designated Breadth-First Traversal file.
Make sure you add the filetype ".txt" when inputting the file, so you do not create any improper files.

The following is an example to run the code:
	"java BinarySearchTree a3input1.txt output1.txt output2.txt"
